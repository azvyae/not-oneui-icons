# Not OneUI Icons

**No more lazy icons!**

**Version 1.0**

![Preview](.github/docs/preview.png)

This repository contains a custom icon set for One UI, featuring altered icons to provide a more consistent look. The default One UI icons often use white backgrounds, which may feel inconsistent with the overall aesthetic. This project aims to provide a sleeker alternative with modified icons.

## Features

- **Consistent Design**: All icons follow a more unified style, removing the default white background found in One UI.
- **Easy to Use**: Simply download the icons and replace the existing ones for a refreshed look.
- **Open Source**: You are free to modify and contribute to this repository.
